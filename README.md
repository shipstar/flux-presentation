Flux presentation for the June Indy.js Meetup

#### How do I run it?
1. `git clone`
2. `npm run install`
3. `npm run watch`

Then open `index.html` via the filesystem or using a simple HTTP server (e.g. `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`).

### Issues

File an issue and I'll take a look, even though this was just a one-off presentation!

Feel free to suggest feature ideas. Maybe I can turn this into a better talk for the next group.
